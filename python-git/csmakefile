[metadata@python-git]
name=python-git
version=0.3.6
description=Enables git api for python (Dependency for csmake-providers)
about=Provides nice porcelain (and plumbing access) to git via python
 This is helpful for build avoidance, tracking tags efficiently, etc.
 Because inside HP we need to access the Internet with proxies
 we need a version of GitPython that allows modifying the environment.
 .
 The pip installation of GitPython installs in a location that is after
 the deb package install in the PYTHONPATH.  Use of this package
 will rectify this problem.
